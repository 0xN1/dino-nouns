# NSFW: DinoNouns | Interactive On-chain NFT

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/0poFBc9.png)

## TL;DR

- Develop an interactive NFT experience using Nouns assets (Dino head-based Nouns)
- On-chain interactive NFT leveraging `animation_url` in NFT metadata
- On-chain HTML, CSS and JS with option for customization 
- Sandbox for creating a new interactive experience for the Nouns ecosystem
- 2 months of work for refining, adding features, and open-sourcing

## **Ideas** ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®

Ohaiii NounsDAO, I'm **Nero One**, an active member from [NounsMY](https://twitter.com/NounsMY)!

I **love to experiment** and **explore different mediums** and NFT, it opens up a new way of doing even more than we could before. 

I've seen some of the stuff people have been doing in the space and it inspires me a lot! But **I saw a lack of creation**/innovation in terms of **interactive** NFT. 


### *The "WHAT IF"*

So I've been thinking, **what if DinoNouns can be interactive** and at the same time the whole thing is all on-chain? What if we can **teach** the character some **words** so it can reply us back? Make it **jump**? Perhaps changing the **DinoTerminal** skins? It would be cool to play with!

Before I continue, here's a quick note on my past projects: 

### *Past Project*

I've **worked on several Interactive NFT projects** and most of it was off-chain, **[COMLINK+](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x1b7e73c6d30dd5dd811cbd26d9bf36e34882fd39/3)** (pointed to a hosted site), **[tulsv1](https://exchange.art/editions/HkMrXQ7NRZy7UuSvLSpW8Vhut7ZnPn9phRYKerCZ8uba)** (uploaded to IPFS).

### *Fully On-Chain?*

However this time I wanted to **fully put** the **whole HTML on-chain + interactive**.

So to achieve this, **all assets need to be encoded in base64** (**HTML, CSS, JS, fonts**) and to be **included in the smart contract**. Oh and I'm **using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS** to make it simple as possible without any other dependencies.

### *Nouns SVG*

For Nouns SVG generation, I'm currently using **NounsDescriptorV2** contract to generate on-chain SVG for **DinoNouns**. To be used in both of the `image` (in teh metadata) and in the HTML itself.

**Seed** for the generation is based on **Dino name** and **tokenId** of the NFT:

`uint256 pseudorandomness = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_name, _id)));`

### *Dynamic NFT?*

Each Dino **name** is **stored on-chain** and to change it, you're required to interact with the DinoNouns contract. **Changing name** will **reroll the Dino** .

Do you want to **re-skin** your **DinoTerminal**? You **can** do it! **Customize your CSS** and **put** that into the **contract**! Oh, it's **token mapped**. So **if you do for your token**, **only u get the custom CSS**!


## **Summary** ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®

### Vision

>**The token is the canvas - Nahiko**

To bring awareness on on-chain interactive NFT and how the community can utilise it

### Objective
1. NounsDAO **community can fork**, **experiment** and **play** with their own **idea/interaction** they want to bring into their project.
2. **Opening up new possibilities** for **future Nouns fork** to embed interaction within the project

### Strategy
1. Build HTML-based interaction with UI/UX
2. Create smart contract architecture for the on-chain interaction and utilisation of HTML, JS and CSS.
3. Make use of the existing Nouns ecosystem [`NounsDescriptor` and `NounsSeeder`]
4. Refine the codebase for future fork
5. Open-source it!
